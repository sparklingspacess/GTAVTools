# GTAVTools
GTAVTools is an extension to SHVDN built in C# used to mainly improve my coding experience but anyone else can use it, credit helps! 

Updates are published within the source code and then into the compiled DLL.

# How to install
Step 1: Make sure you have the latest ScriptHookV (http://www.dev-c.com/gtav/scripthookv/) and ScriptHookV .NET (https://github.com/scripthookvdotnet/scripthookvdotnet-nightly), if not, install them.
Step 2: Make a folder called "scripts" in the same location as GTA5.exe (GTA5_Enhanced.exe if you are using enhanced) and drag-and-drop GTAVTools.dll and GTAVMemScanner.dll into that folder.
Thats it! Now you can use scripts using .NET scripts that require GTAVTools.
